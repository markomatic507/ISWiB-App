# ISWiB-App

Official ISWiB 2019 app, used during the festival. The app is written in Kotlin and is connected with the Cloud Firestore database.

Whenever there are new events or changes to already existing ones, old notifications are deleted and new put in their place. The app also has a secret area for quick on the go data entry.
